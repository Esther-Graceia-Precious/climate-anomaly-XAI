# Climate Anomaly Prediction using Ensemble Learning and Explainable AI

This project predicts climate anomalies using ensemble learning techniques and interpretable models (SHAP). It combines data preprocessing, model training, and explainable AI to understand key drivers of climate behavior.

## Features
- Ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- SHAP visualizations for explainability
- Temporal features (rolling stats, lags)
- Clean and structured climate dataset

## Project Structure
 - data : Contains the dataset
 - src/Model : Python scripts for Modelling
